The file to be copyedited is in Word or .rtf format and therefore can easily be edited as a word processing document. The set of instructions displayed here proposes two approaches to copyediting. One is based on Microsoft Word\'s Track Changes feature and requires that the copy editor, editor, and author have access to this program. A second system, which is software independent, has been borrowed, with permission, from the Harvard Educational Review. The journal editor is in a position to modify these instructions, so suggestions can be made to improve the process for this journal.


<h4>Copyediting Systems</h4>

<strong>1. Microsoft Word\'s Track Changes</strong>

Under Tools in the menu bar, the feature Track Changes enables the copy editor to make insertions (text appears in color) and deletions (text appears crossed out in color or in the margins as deleted). The copy editor can posit queries to both the author (Author Queries) and to the editor (Editor Queries) by inserting these queries in square brackets. The copyedited version is then uploaded, and the editor is notified. The editor then reviews the text and notifies the author.

The editor and author should leave those changes with which they are satisfied. If further changes are necessary, the editor and author can make changes to the initial insertions or deletions, as well as make new insertions or deletions elsewhere in the text. Authors and editors should respond to each of the queries addressed to them, with responses placed inside the square brackets.

After the text has been reviewed by editor and author, the copy editor will make a final pass over the text accepting the changes in preparation for the layout and galley stage.


<strong>2. Harvard Educational Review</strong>

<strong>Instructions for Making Electronic Revisions to the Manuscript</strong>

Please follow the following protocol for making electronic revisions to your manuscript:

<strong>Responding to suggested changes.</strong>
&nbsp; For each of the suggested changes that you accept, unbold the text.
&nbsp; For each of the suggested changes that you do not accept, re-enter the original text and <strong>bold</strong> it.

<strong>Making additions and deletions.</strong>
&nbsp; Indicate additions by <strong>bolding</strong> the new text.
&nbsp; Replace deleted sections with: <strong>[deleted text]</strong>.
&nbsp; If you delete one or more sentence, please indicate with a note, e.g., <strong>[deleted 2 sentences]</strong>.

<strong>Responding to Queries to the Author (QAs).</strong>
&nbsp; Keep all QAs intact and bolded within the text. Do not delete them.
&nbsp; To reply to a QA, add a comment after it. Comments should be delimited using:
<strong>[Comment:]</strong>
&nbsp; e.g., <strong>[Comment: Expanded discussion of methodology as you suggested]</strong>.

<strong>Making comments.</strong>
&nbsp; Use comments to explain organizational changes or major revisions
&nbsp; e.g., <strong>[Comment: Moved the above paragraph from p. 5 to p. 7].</strong>
&nbsp; Note: When referring to page numbers, please use the page numbers from the printed copy of the manuscript that was sent to you. This is important since page numbers may change as a document is revised electronically.

<h4>An Illustration of an Electronic Revision</h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>Initial copyedit.</strong> The journal copy editor will edit the text to improve flow, clarity, grammar, wording, and formatting, as well as including author queries as necessary. Once the initial edit is complete, the copy editor will upload the revised document through the journal Web site and notify the author that the edited manuscript is available for review.</li>
<li><strong>Author copyedit.</strong> Before making dramatic departures from the structure and organization of the edited manuscript, authors must check in with the editors who are co-chairing the piece. Authors should accept/reject any changes made during the initial copyediting, as appropriate, and respond to all author queries. When finished with the revisions, authors should rename the file from AuthorNameQA.doc to AuthorNameQAR.doc (e.g., from LeeQA.doc to LeeQAR.doc) and upload the revised document through the journal Web site as directed.</li>
<li><strong>Final copyedit.</strong> The journal copy editor will verify changes made by the author and incorporate the responses to the author queries to create a final manuscript. When finished, the copy editor will upload the final document through the journal Web site and alert the layout editor to complete formatting.</li>
</ol>',
    'id_ID' => 'Tahap Copyediting dimaksudkan untuk meningkatkan aliran, kejelasan, tata bahasa, kata-kata, dan pemformatan artikel. Tahap ini mewakili kesempatan terakhir untuk penulis untu membuat perubahan substansial apapun pada teks karena tahap selanjutnya terlarang untuk koreksi format dan kesalahan penulisan.

File untuk dicopyedit berupa file Word atau .rtf sehingga dapat diedit dengan mudah.  Petunjuk yang ditampilkan berikut menggambarkan dua pendekatan dalam melakukan copyediting.  Pendekatan pertama, berdasarkan fitur Track Changes di Microsoft Word yang membutuhkan copy editor, editor dan penulis memiliki program ini. Pendekatan kedua, tidak tergantung piranti lunak tertentu, dipinjam dengan seijin dari Harvard Educational Review. Editor Jurnal dapat memodifikasi petunjuk berikut ini dalam rangka meningkatkan proses editorial di jurnal ini.


<h4>Sistem Copyedit</h4>

<strong>1. Track Changes dari Microsoft Office Word</strong>

Di bawah menu Review di Microsoft Office Word, fitur Track Changes memungkinkan copy editor untuk membuat sisipan (teks diberi warna) dan penghapusan (teks diberi coretan dengan warna atau di margin dan ditandai dengan kata dihapus). Copy editor dapat meninggalkan pertanyaan pada penulis (Pertanyaan ke Penulis) dan pada editor (Pertanyaan ke Editor) dengan menyisipkan pertanyaan-pertanyaan di dalam tanda kurung persegi (tanda [...]). Versi yang sudah dicopyedit kemudian diunggah, dan editor diberitahu. Editor kemudian mereview teks dan memberitahu penulis.

Editor dan penulis cukup membiarkan perubahan yang dibuat copy editor jika telah puas dengan perubahan tersebut. Jika perlu perubahan lebih lanjut, editor dan penulis dapat melakukan perubahan dengan penyisipan dan penghapusan dalam naskah yang telah dicopyedit tersebut. Penulis dan editor harus menjawab setiap pertanyaan dari copy editor dengan mengetikkan responnya di dalam tanda kurung persegi tersebut.

Setelah naskah direview oleh editor dan penulis, copy editor akan melakukan pengecekan terakhir untuk tahap layout dan galley.


<strong>2. Harvard Educational Review</strong>

<strong>Instruksi untuk Membuat Revisi Elektronik dalam Naskah</strong>

Mohon ikuti protokol berikut dalam membuat revisi elekronik untuk naskah Anda:

<strong>Merespon perubahan yang disarankan.</strong>
&nbsp; Untuk masing-masing perubahan yang Anda setujui, ubah teks yang ditebalkan ke huruf biasa.
&nbsp; Untuk masing-masing perubahan yang Anda tidak setuju, masukkan kembali teks asli dan <strong>tebalkan</strong>.

<strong>Menambah dan menghapus.</strong>
&nbsp; Tandai tambahan dengan <strong>menebalkan</strong>teks baru.
&nbsp; Gantikan bagian yang dihapus dengan: <strong>[teks dihapus]</strong>.
&nbsp; Jika Anda menghapus satu kalimat atau lebih, mohon berikan catatan, contoh <strong>[dua kalimat dihapus]</strong>.

<strong>Merespon Pertanyaan untuk Penulis (QA/Queries to the Author).</strong>
&nbsp; Jaga semua QA tetap utuh dan tercetak tebal.  Jangan dihapus.
&nbsp; Untuk menjawab QA, tambahkan komentar setelah pertanyaan tersebut. Komentar harus dibatasi dengan menggunakan:
<strong>[Komentar:]</strong>
&nbsp; contoh: <strong>[Komentar: memperdalam pembahasan metodologi seperti yang Anda sarankan]</strong>.

<strong>Membuat Komentar.</strong>
&nbsp; Gunakan komentar untuk menjelaskan perubahan susunan atau revisi besar
&nbsp; contoh: <strong>[Komentar: Memindahkan paragraf di atas dari hal. 5 ke hal. 7].</strong>
&nbsp; Catatan: Saat merujuk suatu nomor halaman, gunakan nomor halaman dari print out naskah yang telah dikirimkan ke Anda. Hal ini penting karena nomor halaman bisa berubah saat dokumen direvisi secara elektronik.

<h4>Ilustrasi Revisi Elektronik </h4>

<ol>
<li><strong>Copyedit Awal.</strong>  Copy editor jurnal akan mengedit teks untuk meningkatkan alur, kejelasan, tata bahasa, diksi dan format, juga termasuk pertanyaan penulis jika perlu. Saat Copyedit Awal selesai, copy editor akan mengunggah dokumen yang sudah direvisi melalui website jurnal dan memberitahu penulis bahwa ada naskah yang telah diedit dan perlu direview kembali oleh penulis.</li>
<li><strong>Copyedit Penulis.</strong>  Sebelum mengubah drastis struktur dan susunan naskah yang sudah diedit, penulis harus bekerjasama dengan editor yang menangani naskah. Penulis harus menerima atau menolak perubahan apapun yang dibuat selama Copyediting Awal, dan merespon semua Pertanyaan ke Penulis (QA). Saat selesai melakukan revisi, penulis harus mengganti nama file dari NamaPenulisQA.doc menjadi NamaPenulisQAR.doc (contoh: dari LeeQA.doc ke LeeQAR.doc) dan mengunggah dokumen yang telah direvisi melalui website jurnal.</li>
<li><strong>Copyedit Akhir.</strong>  Copy editor jurnal akan memverifikasi perubahan yang dibuat oleh penulis dan menggabungkan respon pada Pertanyaan ke Penulis untuk membuat naskah final. Saat selesai, copy editor akan mengunggah naskah final melalui website jurnal dan memberitahu editor layout untuk melanjutkan ke finalisasi format.</li>
